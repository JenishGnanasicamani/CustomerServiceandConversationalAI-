        ## Resolution Completeness Analysis
        
        The 2-message conversation about Technical Support followed a standard customer service pattern. The customer expressed a clear need for technical assistance, and the agent responded with a professional, helpful offer to resolve the issue. This demonstrates good resolution completeness as the agent acknowledged the customer's concern and committed to providing assistance. However, the conversation is incomplete as it shows only the initial exchange without the actual problem-solving steps or resolution confirmation. The agent's response indicates readiness to help but doesn't yet show the detailed troubleshooting or resolution process that would constitute complete resolution.
        
        Based on this analysis, I assign a score of 6.0 for resolution completeness.
