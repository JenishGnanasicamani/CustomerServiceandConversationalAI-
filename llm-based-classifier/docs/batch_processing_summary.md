# Batch Processing Implementation Summary

## Components Implemented

1. **BatchProcessor Class**
   - Connects to MongoDB for data storage
   - Fetches unprocessed queries in batches
   - Processes queries concurrently using async tasks
   - Stores classification results back in MongoDB
   - Provides detailed processing statistics

2. **Command Line Interface (cli.py)**
   - Provides flexible command-line options for the batch processor
   - Supports customizing batch size, concurrency, and MongoDB connection
   - Includes dry-run mode for testing
   - Saves processing statistics to output files

3. **MongoDB Import Utility (utils/mongodb_import.py)**
   - Imports sample customer support queries into MongoDB
   - Supports importing from JSON files or generating sample data
   - Includes mock mode for testing without a real MongoDB connection
   - Exports query data to JSON files

4. **Demo Script (utils/demo_batch_processor.py)**
   - Creates a mock MongoDB environment with sample data
   - Shows the complete batch processor workflow
   - Uses mock LLM responses for testing without an actual LLM service
   - Displays processing statistics and classification results

5. **Documentation**
   - Detailed implementation guide in docs/batch_processor_implementation.md
   - Updated README.md with batch processor usage instructions
   - MongoDB setup instructions for production use

## Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**
  - Uses asyncio for concurrent query processing
  - Configurable concurrency limits to prevent overloading
  - Batched fetching to optimize database operations

- **MongoDB Integration**
  - Stores queries and classification results in MongoDB collections
  - Tracks processing status and attempts for each document
  - Supports custom collection names and database configuration

- **Robust Error Handling**
  - Isolates failures to individual documents
  - Provides detailed error logging
  - Graceful handling of connection issues

- **Mock Testing Support**
  - Works with mongomock-motor for testing without a real database
  - Provides mock LLM responses for testing without an LLM service
  - Demo script to showcase functionality without external dependencies

## Usage Scenarios

1. **Batch Processing of Backlog Queries**
   ```bash
   python cli.py --batch-size 50 --max-concurrent 10
   ```

2. **Dry Run to Check Unprocessed Queries**
   ```bash
   python cli.py --dry-run --output unprocessed.json
   ```

3. **Demo with Mock Data**
   ```bash
   python utils/demo_batch_processor.py
   ```

4. **Import Sample Data**
   ```bash
   python utils/mongodb_import.py --count 100 --output sample_queries.json --mock
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with API**
   - Connect the batch processor to the API for end-to-end processing
   - Add webhook support for notifications when batch processing completes

2. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Add monitoring endpoints to check processing status
   - Implement progress tracking for long-running batch jobs

3. **Retry Logic**
   - Add smart retry mechanisms for failed documents
   - Implement exponential backoff for rate-limited APIs

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Benchmark and optimize query processing performance
   - Add support for distributed processing across multiple instances
